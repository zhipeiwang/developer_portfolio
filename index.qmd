:::{#hero-heading}

Hi! I'm a research master's student in methodology and statistics at Utrecht University, with a special interest in Bayesian statistics and handling high-dimensional data. My research currently explores the use of shrinkage priors for high-dimensional regression to optimize variable selection accuracy and predictive performance.

Outside of my academic life, I enjoy playing the violin, dancing and playing with pets.
